## Happy Customers 


## Predicting if a customer is happy 😃 or not based 😟 on the answers they give to questions asked.


## Data Description:

* Y = target attribute (Y) with values indicating 0 (unhappy) and 1 (happy) customers
* X1 = my order was delivered on time
* X2 = contents of my order was as I expected
* X3 = I ordered everything I wanted to order
* X4 = I paid a good price for my order
* X5 = I am satisfied with my courier
* X6 = the app makes ordering easy for me

I used 6 Supervised Machine learning in this project
**Support Vector Machine (SVM)** gave the highest accuracy **0.77** and F1 scores **0.80**, so I chose this model.
